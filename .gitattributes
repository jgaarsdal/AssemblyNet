### File type and merge tool definitions  ###
## Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto
## Code
*.sh text eol=lf
### Large-File-System file types ###
## Format:
##	*.fileExtension	filter=FilterDriver diff=DiffDriver -text
##		*.fileExtension			Which files to put on LFS (can also be limited to folders). * = wildcard, ! = invert. Order matters, so you can use a wildcard to add a filetype and a ! to invert it after on a specific folder
##		filter=FilterDriver		Which filter driver should be used. We currently only use LFS.
##		diff=DiffDriver			Tells git how to display changes in files. For LFS it does not try to show changes to large files.
##		-text					Tells git that this filetype is NOT text and it should not try to modify line endings.
